     It is up to the creator of this instance to make this id string as unique as makes sense in the context
     that this instance will be used.
     @param threadName the name that should be assigned to the {@link Thread} that this instance will create.
     This might be useful to give the thread a name which will be recognizable in the list of active threads
     that a debugger like the IntelliJ IDEA debugger might provide.
     @param maxCaptureLength the maximum number of bytes to capture. Note that the bytes are captured in a
     {@link ByteArrayOutputStream} which holds its data in a {@code byte} array. Since Java limits all arrays
     to 2<sup>31</sup>-1 elements, the most that can be captured is 2<sup>31</sup>-1 bytes.
     @param discardAfterMaxCaptureLength {@code true} if all data in the input stream after the first
     {@code maxCaptureLength} bytes should be discarded; {@code false} if the input stream should be left
     positioned at the first uncaptured byte should this instance capture {@code maxCaptureLength} bytes.
     @param  immediateStart {@code true} if the worker thread should be started by this constructor;
     {@code false} if the caller takes responsibility for starting the worker thread by invoking the
     newly created instance's {@code start()} method.
